## Motivation

The **Big Bang** project aims to simplify the setup of development environments. It provides an easy way to configure and manage your development tools and settings.

## Target Audience

This project is designed for everyone. Whether for personal or professional use, you are welcome to fork and adapt it as needed.

## Configuration and Usage

### Running the Script

To start the script, use the following command. This project is based on Ansible, but a `Makefile` is provided as the entry point for simplicity:

```shell
make osuser=john.doe gitname=john gitemail=john.doe@email-provider.com
```

## Version manager 

TBD.
> probably we'll consider only version manager to Java (with SdkMan) and Node (with NVM).
> for general purpose we'll consider adsf as version manager
